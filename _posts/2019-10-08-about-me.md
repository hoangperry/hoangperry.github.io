Hi!

I'm **Hoang**{: .ui} and my Vietnamese name is *Trương Nhật Hoàng*.
Now, I'm currently a **computer science** undergraduate student at **Ton Duc Thang university**.

My birdthday is **02<sup>nd</sup> September** and that is the independence day of my country( Vietnam ).
I was born in Nha Trang, but now I'm living in HCMC to convenient for studying at school. Because I can't travel 900 kilometers from home to school daily.

I can play guitar, drum. I think play drum is the best way to relax. My favorite guitarist is Slash-GnR.
