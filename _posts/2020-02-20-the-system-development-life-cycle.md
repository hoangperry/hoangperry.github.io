*In many ways, building an information system is similar to build a house.*

*First, the owner describes the vision for the house the developer.*

*Second, this idea is transformed into sketches and drawings that are shown to the owner and refined util the owner agrees that the pictures depict what he or she wants.*

*Third, a set of detailed buleprints is developed that presents much more sspecific information about the house*

*Finally, the house is built following the blueprint*.

Building an information system using the SDLC follows a similar set of four fundamental phases: planning, analysis, design and implementation.

# 1. Planning

The planning phase is the fundamental process of understanding why an information system should be built and determining how the project team will go about building it.

1. During Project, the system's business value to the organization is identified. Most ideas for new systems come from outside the Information System area in the form of a system request. A system request presents a brief sammary of a business need, and it explains how a system that supports the need will create business value. The IS depoartment works together with the person or department generating the request (project sponsor) to conduct a feasibility analysis. The feasibility analysis examines key aspects of the proposed project.

	- The technical feasibility 
	
	- The economic feasibility

	- The organizational feasibility

The system request and feasibility analysis are presented to an informations systems appoval committee, which decieds whether the project should be undertaken.

2. Once the project is approved, it enters project management. During project management, the project manager creates a work plan, staffs the project, and puts techniques in place to help the project team control and direct the project through the entire SDLC. The delivarable for project management is a project plane that describes how the project will go about developing the system.

# 2. Analysis

# 3. Design

# 4. Implementations

<!-- # Being an analyst

Business Analyst focus on business issues surrounding the system.  Help identify the business value that the system will create-develops ideas for improving the business processes.

The requirements analyst role focuses on eliciting the requirements from the stakeholders associated with the new system.

The infrastructure analyst role focuses on technical issues surrounding the ways the system will interact with the organization's technical infrastructure.
