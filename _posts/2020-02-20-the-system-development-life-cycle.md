*In many ways, building an information system is similar to build a house. There are four steps:*

1. *The owner describes the vision about the house.*

2. *Transform ideas to sketches and refined until the owner agrees that depict what the owner wants.*

3. Develop detailed blueprints much more specific information about the house.

4. *Build the house following the blueprint. Building an information using the SDLC follows a similar set of four fundamental phases:*

# 1. Planning

This phase is the fundamental process of understanding why an information system should be built and determining how the project team will go about building it. There are two steps:

1. The system’s business value to the organization is identified. A system request presents a brief summary of a business need, and it explains how a system will create business value. The feasibility analysis examines key aspects of the proposed project:

	• The technical feasibility

	• The economic feasibility

	• The organizational feasibility

The system request and feasibility are presented to an approval committee who will decide whether the project should be undertaken or not.

2. During the project management, the project manager creates a project plan through the entire SDLC. This describes how the project team will go about developing the system.

# 2. Analysis

This phase answers the questions of 'who will use the system?', 'what the system will do?', 'where and when it will be used?'. This phase has three steps:

1. An analysis strategy is developed to guide the project team’s efforts. It usually includes a study of the current system(as-is-system), envisions ways to design a new system(to-be-system)

2. The next step is requirements gathering. The system concept is then used as a basis to develop a set of business analysis models that describes how the business will operate if the new system were developed.

3. The analyses, system concept and model are combined into a document called the system proposal. This will presented to the project sponsor and other key decision maker. They will decide whether the project should move forward.

The system proposal is describes what business requirements the new system should meet.

# 3. Design

This phase decides how the system will operate in terms. Although most of the strategic decisions about the system are mode in the analysis phase, the steps in the design phase determine exactly how the system will operate. There are four steps:

1. The design strategy clarifies whether the system will be developed by the programmers’ company, whether its development will be outsourced to another firm, or whether the company will buy an software package.

2. Development the basic architecture design for the system that describes more specific about the system(software, hardware, etc.). In most case, the system will reuse the infrastructure that already exists in the organization. The interface design specifies how the users will move through the system.

3. The database and file specifications. This will define exactly what and where data will be stored.

4. The program design will define exactly what each program will do.

# 4. Implementations

This phase will get the most attention, because this phase is the longest and most expensive phase of the development process. There are three steps:

1. System construction. The system is built and tested to ensure that it performs as designed. Most organizations spend more attention on testing than writing the programs.
2. Installation is the process which replaces the old system by the new system. One of the most important aspects is the training plan, to teach users how to use the new system.

3. The analyst team establishes a support plan for the system. This plan usually includes a post-implementation review, as well as a systematic way of identifying major and minor changes needed for the system.
