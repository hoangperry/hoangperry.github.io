*My flight on Vietjet's Airbus A320 will departure at 5:45 AM. This flight will take about 45 Minutes. The A320 is narrow-body airliners usually using for a short flight. It can cover a 5,740 - 6,940 km (3,100 - 3,750 nm) range. Luckily I have a seat nearby the windows so I thinking should make a story about my short flight.*

Let's go!
