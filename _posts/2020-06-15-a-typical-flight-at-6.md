*My flight on Vietjet's Airbus A320 will departure at 5:45 AM, which will take about 45 minutes. The A320 is a narrow-body airliner usually used for a short flight. It can cover a 5,740 - 6,940 km (3,100 - 3,750 nm) range. Luckily, I have seated near the windows so I think I should make a story about my short flight.*

Let's go!

# Pre-flight

My aircraft is taxiing to the runway 02L. IATA code of Cam Ranh airport is CXR and the ICAO code is VVCR. CRX has 2 runways, the other one is usually used for large aircraft like Boeing 777 or Airbus A340 and International flight. This runway is 3.048 meters length and 45 meters of width. It takes about 10 minutes from the passenger stair to holding short position. During the taxi phase, we can hear the sound of APU and air compressor. After 15 minutes, we are in the takeoff position. 2 engines create maximum thrust, flaps at the highest level. Everything will take us to the sky.

# Departure and Climb

Because runway 02L of Cam Ranh airport heading to the North and destination is in the south, in the departure phase, the aircraft must be turned to heading south. This is a short flight, so aircraft just need to reach 10000 feet - 15000 feet of altitude. I really like this phase, we can feel how the aircraft moving in the air. 

*Cam Ranh peninsula, There are a lot of Resort here.*

# En route

When the aircraft reaches the flight altitude, we will move through many waypoints which are planned by the pilot. When arriving at a waypoint, the aircraft will turn to another direction where the next waypoint is placed.
